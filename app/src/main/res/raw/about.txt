# About
My pkgs is an application to list the installed applications.

# Advanced features
If enabled, you can change extra settings, such as category and sort order.
Category "Disablable" reserves the same functions as "Disabling Manager".

** Disable Manager is my unpublished app, because there was a following description to content policy of Google Play.
https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_jp/about/developer-content-policy.html
> App, except when it is part of the security services provided by the app, and encourage users to remove or disable the third-party apps, or induction, must not have or deceive.

This app can be deactivated tab does not appear by default.
In addition, only list the application that you can press the Disable button on the Android specifications, more judgment is due to user, we believe that it is not intended to violate any to content policy.
My pkgs shows an app list that you can press the Disable button on the Android specifications.
And more judgment (disable app or not) is due to user, I believe that it is not violate any to content policy.
